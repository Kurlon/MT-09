# MT-09
Notes gathered while racing a 2024 Yamaha MT-09

As I figure things out, rather than relying on memory I'm taking notes here and if they're useful to others, great!

## Quick Links
Shops with MT-09 / R9 / etc bits:

[Giaccmoto](https://www.facebook.com/p/Giaccmoto-100086162373899/) - One of the primary crews developing these bikes for racing in MotoAmerica's SuperHooligan series. Lots of quality of life parts like steering damper brackets, tank brackets, etc along with motor development including a head and cam package.

[S2 Concept](https://www.s2-concept.com/en/) - From France we find another pocket of people racing these bikes. S2 Concept has bodywork including bolt up seat pans and belly pans along with other race accessories.
