# Brakes
The base 2024 MT-09 uses the same Advics radial calipers that Yamaha has used for YEARS across various bikes, particularly the 3rd Generation R6. SP models get upgraded to Brembo Stylemas. Both bikes use the same 17mm Brembo radial master and are plumbed through an ABS system.

## Pads
### Advics Calipers
EBC specs out FA252 pads for the MT-09, and doesn't offer them in their racier compounds. EBC for the R6 specs out FA380 pads, and offers them in their GPFAX compound. The pads are the same backing plate and thickness, FA252s come with anti-rattle shims, FA380s don't. Forget the FA252s exist, shop around FA380 and matching pad fitments from other providers. I'm trying DP RDP418 'RDP X-Race Titanium' pads this year on my MT-09.

Plumbed through the stock lines and ABS module, the stock 17mm Brembo master feels OK, now that I've switched to direct lines from Core Moto I'm a little worried that I'll be slightly over-mastered. On the R6 Yamaha paired these calipers with a 16mm radial master, the Advics run a slightly smaller piston area than the Stylemas. I have a couple OEM R6 masters on standby if I don't like the feel of the Brembo.

### Brembo Stylema Calipers
Haven't chased pads on these. On paper these calipers should be about 100g lighter per side than the Advics?

# Ditching Keys
Standard race prep is to get rid of anything needing a key so you don't have to worry about that on track. Unfortunately, given how few of these bikes are raced most of those parts haven't been adapted to the MT-09 yet.

## Tank
Everywhere lists the 2024+ MT-09 as working with the same keyless gas cap assemblies as the 21-23 MT-09, R6 forever, etc. This is not the case, the bolt circle is larger, and the actual tank opening is at the bottom of the bolt circle instead of the top as is normally the case on Yamahas. No keyless cap exists for these tanks yet.

## Seat
S2 Concepts out of France makes a race tail for these bikes that will let you toss the OEM seats (5lbs?!) and some of the heavy steel subframe bracketry to retain them. I've not done this upgrade yet myself.

## Ignition
Yamaha seems to be using the 2024 MT-09 to try out all sorts of new parts that don't cross to anything else. The ignition switch is one such item, unique to the 24+ MT-09 using a different connector than they ever used. No keyswitch elimination kit exists yet.

The switch uses a 6 pin, .250in wide contact connector that appears to be a 'Sumitomo' design last seen on old Kawi regulator rectifier connections. The keyswitch is a double pole single throw unit, no parking light position. SP bikes also have an immobilizer antenna to contend with. The switch jumps two circuits, one is basically an ECU 'go' trigger, the other is the main 12v feed from the batt to the rest of the harness, no relays or anything to lower the current running through the switch.

When you look at the connector, there are four wires, two thin wires, two thick wires, one of each on each side of the connector. The thin wires are the 'go' signal, thick are the power feed. Looking at the keyswitch side connector, looking into it with the locking tab facing up, the wires are:

| | locking tab | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue with black stripe | | Red |
| Orangw with blue stripe | | Blue |
