# Front End
## Cartridges
Ohlins, K-Tech and others make cartridge kits for the MT-09, I've not ridden at a level where I can have a strong opinion here. I just stay with what the suspension tech I'm getting help from has the  most experience with. Experience is priceless.

# Rear End
## Shocks
Again, Ohlins, K-Tech, Penske, pick your poison. Currently Ohlins only lists their STX shock for the MT-09, on the Gen 4 bikes the bracket for the resi needs a bit of manual adjustment to keep from driving bits into the frame. I suspect ordering the OEM shock bracketry for the SP would tuck things in slightly better and may try that myself this winter. The TTX option available for the R9 may fit as well, seen it on some Hooligan machines already...

## Linkages
There are two options besides stock that I'm aware of right now, [Attack Performance](https://attackyamaha.com/125109g.html) has one listed for the R9, which uses the 4th gen MT-09 swingarm and linkage normally so should be a drop in. [Lucan](https://www.lucandesign.co.uk/2021-2023-yamaha-mt-09-performance-shock-linkage) in the UK offers one as well for the Gen 3 machines, should drop into a Gen 4 as well?

## Swingarms
The R9 comes with the MT-09's swingarm, and racers are tossing it right out of the crate. [2WDW](https://2wheeldynoworks.com/) has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2-2hTcY0mI) going over their R9 build and discusses this. TLDR going to a longer XSR / Tracer swingarm provides more room for larger race rubber, helps keep the front end down on hard acceleration, and improves drive grip. This makes for a 'comically' long wheelbase of nearly 59 inches on paper, but having seen what MTs and an R9 with that setup can do on a tight track like Loudon at all of 1.6mi they still turn damn well?

The target PN is B5U-22110-00-00. This was used on the XSR900 from 2022 to 2025 currently. The Tracer 9 used it from 2021 to 2025 currently. MSRP is only $1850... ouch! If going used, make sure it's straight.
